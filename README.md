### intro
Introducing the best and simplest 34-key keyboard layout, yet. It features Colemak-DH layout with some modifications. There are 5 layers: 4 home row layer holds; number, navigation, mouse keys, and system layers; 1 thumb layer symbol hold. Next, are bottom row mods with ctrl on right thumb hold. A dedicated repeat key, and dedicated sticky shift on thumbs. 2 bottom row gui (cmd) mods per side on index and middle fingers and 1 alt (option) bottom row mod per side on ring ringers. Home row pinky holds each sport the ever so popular ctrl-option-shift (meh) key for fast app switching and other OS customizable shortcuts.

### context
There are some decisions I made that I think would be beneficial to make here with this context: I mainly use this keyboard for programming in vim as you'll see in the layout of the symbol layer and the base layer. Moreover, I wanted the layer configurations to be easy to remember and simple. I use one monitor and full screen all my apps; with the help of software discussed below I can switch apps quickly without having to use the mouse. In general, I prefer to never have to touch the mouse or move the cursor during any of my workflows. More often than not, it is the case with few exceptions like when I need to use some complicated UI in a browser. In that case, I'll use the mouse or a trackpad. While I use the mouse I can also input much needed keys from my left hand, such as tab, return, space, esc, app switcher, backspace, and more. 

### base layer tap keys
I used to have the backspace key on a layer and after running a key logger on my computer for about a week, space, backspace, E, N, T were the most typed keys. Simply moving the backspace to a dedicated tap on thumb has proven especially useful if I want to lazily delete a lot of letters. I can tap-backspace then tap-key-repeat on the other thumb and alternate drumming on the keyboard with my thumbs--which has been fun to do from time to time. 
The key-repeat has been such a joy to use especially during a complicated set of hold-taps. I can just simply key-repeat it with as many times as I want. Also, the dedicated sticky shift has been especially nice on thumb as that is one key that I don't like to hold while typing.
I've tried moving the symbols on the base layer around but it proved to be not beneficial as I was already accustomed to having easy access to comma, period, slash, and apostrophe. Although I have changed the shifted versions of those quite a bit. For example, I tried moving / and ? to the symbol layer and putting " with shift ' in its place. Because of python, I needed a quick way to type " after a ( and before a capital letter without immediately having a single thumb bigram (STB). Typing something like, ("Hello") would just require a thumb-hold-sym-layer, tap-(, release-sym, tap-", thumb-tap-shift which is another thumb key, H. If I had " on a layer or on shift (consider it another layer) then the thumb swap would have to be more immediate. For the same example as above if " was shifted I would have to thumb-hold-sym-layer, tap-(, release-sym, immediately swap and thumb-tap-shift, tap-", thumb-tap-shift, tap-H. The whole idea was to minimize STBs. In the end, I missed easy access to / in vim and a quick ' while typing prose. So I put everything back. I noticed however, " and . were causing a pinky and ring finger scissor that was very unplesant to type ." so I moved the < and > to symbol layer and put ! above the , and the " above the . (." scissor gone). Also, it's easier to type !" and ?" with " existing in between ! and ? while all being shifted. I found it easier to map all the other symbols to a separate layer that activates with a thumb hold.
I also tried to put - on top right side because it is occasionally used and sometimes beneficial if it's on the base layer instead of another layer. I decided to move it back to a layer for the more typically and often needed '. I decided to put it into an easier to reach spot like where . is and move _ to the left side where X is to mirror each other. 

### base layer hold keys
None of the layers are toggleable. They all only activate on some key hold and deactivate on key released. That intentionally makes the keyboard always rest at the base layer. I was getting tired and confused accidentally typing symbols, moving the mouse, highlighting some text, or worse switching a bluetooth connection because if I had implemented a &to <layer> or toggle layer for any layer I would forget to toggle off or tap to go &to 0 (to base layer). This has been one of the most common issues I've had with toggle/to layer assigned keys. Often I was forgetting that some layer was active and then proceeded to type what I need and finding out I've typed nothing but mouse movements, lol. Using only momentary hold layers proved its worth. The other thing is there's an option in ZMK to use sticky layers but I found that those only activated after some arbitrary time on holding a key, while momentary hold layers activated right away and I didnt have to mess with experimenting with timeouts. 
The space key contains an important hold-ctrl which is heavily used in vim, that's why I preferred it to be on a dedicated thumb key instead of bottom row mods.
Speaking of bottom row mods which I chose before moving layer holding to the homerow was because I figured using Colemak-DH home row is so heavily typed on, I didn't want to have to deal with misfires with mod-taps so I moved the mods to the bottom row which was itself severely less typed on. Later, after tuning the mod-tap flavor and timeouts I could assign the home row keys to layer switching which proved more ergonomic. I now use home row for layer switching and it is more comfortable and more often used than bottom row mods. I also mapped 2 cmd mod keys per side (one for index, one for middle fingers) because if I need to do a one-handed cmd-<any key> I can by holding either cmd mod key. Which is something not possible to do with just one mod key. For example, I can get cmd-C and cmd-D with one hand, or cmd-H and cmd-, with one hand and I don't need to cross-hand type cmd-key commands. Nor do I need to cross my fingers to type something like cmd-S if I only have cmd on middle fingers.
On the home row I have meh, mouse, navigation, and numbers layers (left to right). I use meh for quickly switch apps using tools like PowerToys (Win) or Rectangle, Hammerspoon, or Raycast (Mac); where I assign shortuts like meh-T to focus my terminal, meh-S to focus my browser, and so on. There are really just 5-6 apps that I'll assign hotkeys to which I most frequently use and thats it. Occasionally, I will split two apps side-by-side and in that case meh-F is a shortcut to split window left, meh-P split right, and meh-W back to fullscreen; all without ever using the mouse to resize the windows or switch the apps. I want to map hyper keys to Z and / but haven't had a need for using them yet.

### symbols
First and foremost, the symbol layer was hand rolled by me with some inspiration from researching various layouts. I specifically designed this around how I use the nav layer and how it relates to programming in vim. Starting with the left hand. I put on same-row opening and closing {} () [] symbols instead of on same column as to avoid having SFB for open-close typing of brackets and such. Concerning the rest of the symbols, they were placed by grouping as much as possible and to be easy to remember. The main idea of having: ^ * # $ in that order. Those keys correspond to vim: ^ jumps to beginning of line, * jumps to next (down) occurance of the word under cursor, # previous (up) occurance of the word under cursor, and $ jumps to the end of the line. The navigation layer has arrow keys that match the vim style navigation of the cursor (left, down, up, right). The rest of the symbols were put to mirror each other or in easy to reach spots that'll minimize SFBs while typing symbols.

### navigation 
This layer will contain typical vim style arrow keys on the right that get activated while holding S with or without mods with my left hand. I also included typical page down/up, end/home keys on separate columns that match the vim style down/up arrows for consistency and ease of remembering. Although, I barely use them even while vimming. The extra tap keys on the left side are for when I'm using the mouse to do some work and I need to do a tab or return, I can hit those keys with just using my left hand. It makes it convenient so i dont have to move my right hand to hit the tab or return combo and then have to move my right hand back to using the mouse.

### numbers
Pretty much same as navigation layer in that I can hold-T with or without mods and type numbers and some symbols with the right hand. 

### mouse
Pretty much the same as navigation and number layers. The left thumb has a slow mouse sub layer that when held will make the cursor move slower on screen. I had another key on the left hand that activated a mouse scroll sub layer when held but I figured that I can mimic vim style mouse scrolling on the mouse layer on the bottom right keys because a lot of the time I reach for scroll functionality more than mouse movements and sequentially getting to the proper holding of 2 keys on the left hand sometimes caused misfires, was annoying to hold for a long time, and sometimes I couldn't get the sequence right and would otherwise accidentally activate the nav layer of something.

### combos
I tried putting more layers down for these combos but just couldn't stick to hold-tap over combos. For example, a quick "LU" triggers the cmd-Left combo which takes me to the beginning of the line in some text (on Mac). The alternative would be to hold-S (nav layer), hold-T (cmd mod in nav layer), tap-Left (3 sequential key presses) to do the same as above. Furthermore, I only need to tap the combo once, never repeatedly--going to beginning of the line can't be done multiple times at least last time I checked. Therefore, for that shortcut it makes sense to have it as a combo. A lot of the combos are keyboard shortcuts that only need to be tapped once. Furthermore, if I do need to tap a combo repeatedly, the key-repeat is close by. For example, to jump or highlight words on a Mac in some piece of text I can jump back a word using 2 ways: hold-S, hold-R (option), tap-Left, key-repeat (if necessary) or tap "NU" keys together (combo), key-repeat (if necessary), the latter being way easier and faster to do. Tapping the sticky shift before the combo will highlight the previous word and tapping key-repeat on that can help highlight consecutive previous words--as many times as needed. That's how I see the efficiency of combos when used with key repeat. I think if I keep finding that I use some type of shortcuts often that require many sequential holds, I'll simply move them to a combo and that'll improve my workflow even more. 

### conclusion 
All in all, this has been the most comfortable layout for me and one that I plan on using for a while. Keys are easy to reach, and layers and combos are sensibly laid out. This is the best layout for programming, using vim, and low use of pinkies. Thanks to layers (nav, num, sym, mouse), combos, and the thumb cluster.
